# CS415
From syllabus:

This course is an introduction to the theory and practice behind modern computer operating systems.  Topics will include what an operating system does (and does not) do, system calls and interfaces, processes, concurrent programming, resource scheduling and management (e.g., CPU, memory, devices), virtual memory, deadlocks, distributed systems and networks, and security.  We will approach the subject from both a theoretical perspective (what are the abstractions and algorithms?) as well as a practical one (what are the mechanisms and how are they built?).

Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the following skills:
  - Demonstrate facility with using the Linux software development environment
  - Demonstrate the ability to develop programs that use processes
  - Demonstrate the ability to develop programs that use threads
  - Demonstrate the ability to develop programs using processes and threads
  - Demonstrate the ability to use synchronization mechanisms in concurrent programs
